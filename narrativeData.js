    a club foot. Because it was the last day of our trip we didn’t have
    time to treat him and this really bothered me. Our last trip in
    November of 2021 I saw a young man of 18 in the clinic and I knew it
    was him. I was able to get him into surgery right away. Due to the
    complicated nature of 18 years of club foot it was an intense
    surgery and lasted several hours. The team was exhausted but
    thrilled, it was a successful surgery! I am looking forward to our
    next visit in April so I can see him for a follow-up and make sure
    his recovery is going smoothly. If we had better funding we could
    support the Dominican Orthopedic Surgeons with more thorough
    follow-up with patients on post surgical treatments."`,
