          <h3>Foot and Ankle Orthopedic Surgeon</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Several years ago while on a mission trip a 15 year old boy from an orphanage, with no adult accompanying him, came into the clinic on the last day we were there. He had a club foot, which is a congenital deformity where his foot is turned 90 degrees inward and he walks on the outside of his ankle. We don’t see this in the U.S. because it is fixed at birth. And the longer a club foot goes untreated the more risk is involved in a surgical intervention. Because it was the last day of our trip we didn’t have time to treat him and this really bothered me so I got his name, contact info and took his picture b/c I wanted to make sure I was able to treat him on our next visit. Unfortunately, due to Covid, our next trip was canceled. I thought a lot about him, regretting again that I was not able to treat him before. Our last trip in November of 2021 I was eager to find him. Early in the week I saw a young man of 18 in the clinic and I knew right away it was him. I lit up because I was so excited to see him with enough time to treat him. I went right up to him and said “Do you remember me?” He did not, so I went through my phone and found his picture from years ago. He smiled and said, “Oh yes, that is me! I remember you now.” I was able to get him into surgery right away. Due to the complicated nature of 18 years of club foot it was an intense surgery and lasted 4 hours. The team was exhausted but thrilled, it was a successful surgery! I am looking forward to our next visit in April so I can see him for a follow-up and make sure his recovery is going smoothly. If we had better funding we could support the Dominican Orthopedic Surgeons with more thorough follow-up with patients on post surgical treatments. I feel nervous for him because I don’t know how his recovery has been and am very eager to see him again in April.</p>
