          I agreed to attending the mission without really knowing much about
          the culture or situation in the Dominican Republic. I was surprised to
          find out that we were caring for Haitians primarily. The Haitians that
          come to DR to work and try to have a safer life aren’t treated well.
          They don’t always have access to safe water, food, housing and health
          care. Many Haitians in DR live in areas called Bateys. These
          communities often don’t have running water or electricity.
        </p>

          It is difficult because there is a huge need for medical help and we
          don’t have the time or the equipment to help everyone. During the
          clinic on Sunday over 70 people arrived hoping that we could help
          them. In November, over the course of one week, the team performed 27
          surgeries. I was one of the CRNAs that attended. The week was filled
          with many challenges and long days. The hospital where we performed
          the surgeries is called El Buen Samaritan’s. The staff there were
          welcoming and helpful. They seemed very supportive of our work. Still
          it was challenging as all of the anesthesia equipment, supplies, and
          medications were not like we were used to. We had to bring as many
          supplies as possible to make sure we could help as many people as
          possible.

          One specific story I can tell is about a young man we cared for. He
          was around 17 or 18 and arrived at the clinic with his father. His leg
          had been injured in a scooter/ motorcycle accident and had healed
          poorly. Every step seemed painful and he walked with a cane. He
          reminded me a bit of my teenage son. Trying to dress and act tough, a
          little angry at the adults in his life and embarrassed by having to be
          seen out in public with a parent. Craving his independence but not
          having a clue how to get it. I remember him also because his cane was
          broken and slippery on the bottom. I took the cane down to the OR area
          while he was seen by the surgeons and did what I could do to make his
          cane function better. I basically splinted it and wrapped it with
          surgical tape. A few days later I was walking through the lab area
          from the OR to where we ate lunch and saw the patient and his father.
          The young man had to get his covid test before we did surgery on him
          the next day. His father seemed so happy to see me and was desperately
          trying to communicate in Spanish with me. His son again looked annoyed
          and embarrassed. I found an interpreter and through her found out that
          his son couldn’t work because of his barely functioning leg. The
          father was so worried his son would end up getting into trouble if he
          wasn’t able to have a legitimate job. No surgeons in the Dominican
          Republic had been able to offer his son any options other than a cane.
          He wanted me to know how thankful he was for us coming there and
          helping. He said “God bless the Americans”.
        </p>

          A great thing that happened in our team is that the roles of surgical
          tech, surgeon, nurse, anesthetist etc. got blurred and we were just a
          team doing whatever needed to be done. We all looked out for each
          other and the hierarchical pressures were erased. We all pitched in to
          give the best care possible.
        </p>

          In short I am proud of the work we did. It was an honor to be a part
          of the mission. It is important to remember that by pure luck and by
          no feat of my own that I won some kind of social lottery to have the
          privileges I have.
