                  Provide planning, staffing and support for 1-2 orthopedic

                  Work with local physicians and medical staff in exchanging

            <h3>Nitty Gritty</h3>

            <p>
              We have 2 operating rooms and can generally perform 3
              surgeries/room/day which means we can get 6-8 cases done a day. We
              do surgeries Monday–Thursday, so on average we do 24 surgeries
              each visit in addition to clinic pre and post surgery care.
            </p>
            <h3>Long-term Goals</h3>
            <p>
              With more funding we could expand the mission trip to incorporate
              a knowledge exchange with Dominican surgeons and surgical
              residents to create a deeper impact where the American team
              teaches the Dominican team their techniques and the Dominicans
              share their skills, tools and resources as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Dominican surgeons who work at the charitable hospital have
              other full-time hospital jobs because the work with the charitable
              hospital is either volunteer or paid extremely low wages. With
              increased funding we could support our team’s costs while also
              contributing towards the Dominican health care providers wages.

            "Several years ago while on a mission trip a 15 year old boy from an
            orphanage came into the clinic on the last day we were there. He had
            a club foot. Because it was the last day of our trip we didn’t have
            time to treat him and this really bothered me. Our last trip in
            November of 2021 I saw a young man of 18 in the clinic and I knew it
            was him. I was able to get him into surgery right away. Due to the
            complicated nature of 18 years of club foot it was an intense
            surgery and lasted several hours. The team was exhausted but
            thrilled, it was a successful surgery! I am looking forward to our
            next visit in April so I can see him for a follow-up and make sure
            his recovery is going smoothly. If we had better funding we could
            support the Dominican Orthopedic Surgeons with more thorough
            follow-up with patients on post surgical treatments."

            <p>Each trip costs about <strong>$25K</strong>.</p>

            <p>
              Each trip requires personnel to provide quality health care to the
              patients. The health care professionals who volunteer use personal
              vacation time or unpaid time off to donate their services on these
              trips. We would like to support our team of volunteers by covering
              the costs of travel and room and board.
            </p>

            GLORI provides all the medical materials when they are there. (El
            Buen Samaritano Hospital is supportive of these trips but does not
            have the financial ability to provide any materials.) Your donations
            will go towards the following costs:
