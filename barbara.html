        <p>First, a few thoughts about the mission:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Caribbean Island of Hispaniola is home to two countries: Haiti and Dominican Republic.</li>
          <li>
            Both have populations of around 10 million.
          </li>

          <li>
            Many individuals find their way to DM to work in sugarcane factories.

          </li>
          <li>
            Several of our patients are in very poor health without medical insurance.
          </li>
          <li>
            One night I couldn’t sleep, so I went down to the mission kitchen and experienced such simplicity…. With merengue music playing from a small transistor radio one security guard was playing checkers with a friend.

          </li>

          <li>
            Simple meals with totally yummy desserts! Double layer chocolate cake.

          </li>


          <li>
            Comradeship with your dorm mates, learning about their lives and interests.

          </li>

          <li>You learn about yourself, one's tolerances, untapped abilities, and strengths, how little one needs to live on.
          </li>
          <li>A young female patient tried conversing with me during her anesthesia… attempting to use the google Spanish to English translator…her response to asking how she was doing, went something like “ don’t cut longer because after that scar you look ugly” … we reassured her that our surgeons were the best!</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>November 2021, my best story</strong>:</p>
 
        <p>Experiencing a lunar eclipse on the rooftop at the mission house, in the Dominican Republic, the longest in 600 years…an experience that parallels that of the medical mission.</p>
         
        <p>
          I woke at 3</br>
          I rose at 4</br>
          And went out in the dark</br>
          By the mission kitchen door.</br>
          Someone was stealing the moon!
        </p>
         
         
        <p>
          Myranda said, don’t worry about the moon</br>
          We are due in the OR soon!</br>
          But the present</br>
          Was too precious to waste on sleep</br>
          
        </p>
         
        <p>
          In the dark of night…we sat…then light!</br>
          Top left, a silver light shone bright</br>
          Slowly, light returned, left to right</br>
          Until the full moon was reborn.</br>
          Shining anew with a fresh, dazzling light.
        </p>
         
        <p>
          Darkness tries to eclipse light</br>
          But as long as there is love</br>
          Shadows remain illusions and only that.</br>
        </p>
         
        <p>
          If the world stopped for bad stuff, then everything would be dark. But the world keeps going so that we can find the crack of light that leads to healing. The only thing people regret is that they didn’t live boldly enough, that they didn’t invest enough heart, didn’t love enough.
