          <h3>Ortho Surgeon and Organizer</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          Everytime I go to the DR to do surgeries I want to do more, so I keep organizing trips to go back.
          The orthopedic surgeries we are performing in the DR are no different than the daily surgeries we do in the States. The difference is that there are plenty of resources here so people can get the care they need easily enough. In the DR, with the vulnerable populations we serve, if we were not there to help, there is nothing. There is no social safety net in the DR for the people who can’t pay for care. No Medicaid. No insurance. Out of pocket or nothing. This has a negative impact on the whole social structure, not only the individual we help. Care for the individual leads to communal good. Most of the patients we see are unable to work due to their injuries. If they can’t work they are a burden on their families because they can’t provide for anyone. This puts strain on the family as well as the community. Never mind the mental health and emotional stress this causes. Our work puts people back to work so they can be contributing members to society.
        </p>

<p>One young man, 17 years old, had a fractured tibia and couldn’t walk. The injury would not heal on its own and he was looking at a long-term disability. He played baseball before the injury and he was very depressed because he couldn’t play anymore.We performed a successful surgery and I am eager to get back for a follow-up to see how he is healing. If we had better resources we could begin a surgery follow-up program in order to make sure our patients are seeing the recovery they need.</p>
